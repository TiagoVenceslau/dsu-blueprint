## Installation

After cloning this repository, execute:

```shell
$ npm install
```
This will install all required dependencies

```shell
$ npm run sever
```
This will start the Api Hub server, enabling you to interact with the OpenDSU framework.
Wait for completion. You will see a similar message to:

```server is listening on port 8080``` 


In another terminal:

```shell
$ npm run build-all
```
This will 'build' all necessary DSUs
(you should see a ```seed``` file in the root some the folders, containing a KeySSI)
